Fantasy Premier League Dashboard

Currently in progress but this is what I have so far. My idea was to create a dashboard where someone could quickly compare two players that they were thinking about putting in thir fantasy team.

Things I still need to do:
- Format everything correctly
- Make the graphs selectable, so you can select the metric to compare
- Add in a few more key statistics
- Create a prediction model to predict a players points for the next game week


This is currently what the dashboard looks like:
